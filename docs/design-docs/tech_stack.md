# Updated Technology Stack Overview

This document outlines the primary technologies and frameworks that compose our dynamic security log mapping tool. The solution is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, leveraging Python Flask for the back-end services, Docker for containerization, and a combination of supporting tools for storage, search, and orchestration. Below are suggested refinements to optimize our architecture under production conditions.

---

## 1. Python & Flask (Backend Services)

1. **Flask Framework**  
   - Purpose: Build RESTful endpoints to ingest, classify, and serve security log data.  
   - Why Flask? Lightweight, easy to integrate with Python libraries for ML, data processing, and Trieve SDK.  
   - Production Suggestion: Run Flask with a production-grade WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) to handle concurrency efficiently.

2. **Python 3.9+**  
   - Purpose: Implements application logic (ingestion, classification, knowledge base) with a modern Python version.  
   - Benefits: Rich ecosystem of security-focused libraries, data processing tools (pandas, etc.), and ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, spaCy).  
   - Refinement: Python 3.9 or higher ensures better support for typing and more recent standard library enhancements.

3. **Trieve Python Client**  
   - Purpose: Direct interaction with the Trieve platform for chunk creation, hybrid/semantic search, and RAG usage.  
   - Key Packages: “trieve-py-client” from PyPI.  
   - Notes: Ensure pinned version to align with any advanced RAG or chunk-based operations.

## 2. UI / Frontend

1. **Web Framework**: React or Vue (to be determined)  
   - Purpose: Provide a user-friendly interface for SOC analysts to review, override, or confirm classification results in real time.  
   - Features: Real-time dashboards, search pages, and detailed event views.

2. **Integration with Flask**  
   - Typically a separate container or served behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.).  
   - Communicates with Flask endpoints over REST APIs.

---

## 3. Containerization & Orchestration

1. **Docker**  
   - Purpose: Package each service (Flask backend, UI, supporting services) into isolated containers.  
   - Benefits: Consistency across environments (dev, test, prod).  

2. **Docker Compose**  
   - Purpose: Orchestrate local development with a single command.  
   - Typical Entities: Flask services, Trieve (if self-hosting), Qdrant, ClickHouse, Redis, etc.

3. **Kubernetes (Optional)**  
   - For larger-scale or production deployments.  
   - Helm charts or direct manifests can replicate Docker Compose setups.

4. **Refinement**:  
   - For smaller teams or simpler environments, Docker Compose is often enough. If scale or reliability demands increase, consider using a fully managed Kubernetes environment.

---

## 4. Storage & Databases

1. **ClickHouse**  
   - Purpose: High-performance analytical database for storing large volumes of logs and classification results.  
   - Use Case: Fast queries over event data (e.g., time-based searches, dashboards).  

2. **Trieve (Built-In Vector Storage) or Qdrant**  
   - Purpose: Store vector embeddings for semantic search.  
   - For maximum simplicity, rely on Trieve’s own vector management. If you want to maintain local embeddings or advanced experiments, Qdrant is a solid choice.  

3. **Redis / Kafka / RabbitMQ (Message Queue)**  
   - Purpose: Optional for buffering logs between ingestion and classification, ensuring reliable delivery under high load.

4. **Refinement**:  
   - If using “etrieve-py-client” with the Trieve default vector store, you may skip Qdrant.  
   - For highly distributed or advanced custom retrieval, Qdrant or other vector DB can be integrated.

---

## 5. Classification & Search

1. **Trieve**  
   - Purpose: Central platform for chunk storage (OCSF classes, doc references) and advanced retrieval (BM25, SPLADE, hybrid).  
   - Integration: Accessed via “trieve-py-client” from within Flask services.

2. **ML / LLM**  
   - Purpose: Potential re-ranker or cross-encoder layer to enhance precision.  
   - Common Models: spaCy, FastText, logBERT, or open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama 2) for advanced classification.  
   - Refinement: Caching or batching requests is recommended if an LLM re-ranker is used in real-time.

3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
   - Purpose: Combine knowledge base chunks from Trieve with an LLM for summarization or context-based classification.  
   - Usage: Store user interactions and LLM outputs back into Trieve for analytics or iterative improvements.

---

## 6. CI/CD & DevOps

1. **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**  
   - Purpose: Automated builds, tests, and deployments for Python services and front-end.  
   - Benefits: Ensures code quality, consistent container images, and quick feedback loops.

2. **Environment Management**  
   - `.env` files or environment variables for secrets and configs (e.g., TRIEVE_API_KEY, dataset IDs).  
   - Production Secrets: Use Vault, AWS Parameter Store, or another secrets manager.

3. **Refinement**:  
   - Include linting (flake8, black) and testing steps in CI.  
   - Add push-to-registry steps for Docker images if needed.

---

## 7. Security & Compliance

1. **Secure Transmission**  
   - TLS/HTTPS for all communication.  
   - Add a reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik) if hosting multiple services under one domain.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**  
   - Implement at the Flask layer or via an API gateway.  
   - OAuth, JWT, or a custom SSO integration recommended for production.

3. **Secrets Management**  
   - `.env.sample` in code; real `.env` or external vault in production.  
   - Provide strong RBAC for environment secrets.

---

## 8. High-Level Summary

- **Backend**: Python Flask for ingestion-service, classification-service, and knowledge-base, containerized with Docker.  
- **Frontend**: React or Vue, served from a separate container or behind a proxy.  
- **Data & Storage**: ClickHouse for large-scale log analytics, optional Qdrant if you need local vector DB. Otherwise rely on Trieve built-in.  
- **Search & Classification**: Trieve for chunk management, hybrid/semantic retrieval, and optional RAG. Python-based ML/LLM for advanced classification.  
- **DevOps**: Docker Compose for local dev, optional Kubernetes for production at scale. CI/CD with GitHub Actions or equivalent.  
- **Security**: Encrypted transport, secrets management, optional RBAC or SSO integration.

---

## 9. Future Considerations

1. **Self-Improving Pipeline**:  
   - Feed misclassifications and user overrides into an active learning loop.  
2. **Advanced Observability**:  
   - Integrate Prometheus/Grafana or Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana (ELK) for logs and metrics.  
3. **Scaling**:  
   - Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes, auto-scaling classification engines based on log volume.  
4. **Enhanced Mapping**:  
   - Expand beyond OCSF to additional security schemas like MITRE ATT&CK or Sigma rules.  
5. **Offline Processing**:  
   - For large data sets, batch or offline workflows using Apache Airflow or Prefect.

By adopting Python Flask for the back-end, a Docker-based workflow for containerization, and Trieve for search and RAG, this tech stack is well-suited for both rapid development and production readiness. The additions of advanced concurrency, caching, and message-queuing (as necessary) ensure robust performance under high event volumes, while well-established CI/CD, secrets management, and security practices round out a highly effective approach for this project.
